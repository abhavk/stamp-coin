This means that owners of the StampCoin can choose to sell any of their StampCoin for bAR. And holders of bAR can choose to purchase any listed StampCoin with their bAR. More to come here.

* stamp

Any `vouch-for` wallet can create a stamp for any arweave transaction. This feature would be part of any decentralized App that chooses to display the arweave transaction, this includes Atomic NFTs, dApps, and other data assets that exist on the blockweave.

* reward

This is the mechanism that distributes rewards to all of the creators that have the most stamped assets in the community. The reward system will run until 10% of the coin supply has been distributed. The reward function can only be run by the coin creator.
